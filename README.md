# Kawaiicon

A set of kawaii (cute) vscode icons. Inspired by bearded-icon and glyph for vscode

> [!NOTE] This icon pack is inpired by [Bearded Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BeardedBear.beardedtheme) & [Glyph for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lewxdev.vscode-glyph). I combined Glyph's folder icons and Bearded's file icons.

> I want to make it better in the future. If an icon is missing, should be added, or you have any suggestion please create an issue or contribute! :)
